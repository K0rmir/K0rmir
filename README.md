# Hey, I’m K0rmir, better known as Edd. 👋
I’m a Junior Full Stack Software Developer with a keen interest in data, API's & back-end technologies. 
## About Me
- I'm a career switcher, leaving behind a successful 5 year career in Paid Digital Marketing to pursue my long standing interest in coding & software development.
- I’m currently building out my own API, [boardapi](https://github.com/K0rmir/boardgameapi)!
- Here you'll find my personal coding projects as I add to my portfolio!
- Always up for collaborating with others!
